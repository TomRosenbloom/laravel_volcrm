# Volcrm to do

Create email alerts to self to log activity i.e. any admin registrations or logins and data changes so I can keep on top of the state of the data.

Dismiss confirmation messages

Table of cities, drop down in address form (lift from laravel contacts)

Correct way to add js - compiling to app.js (as per css)

Anonymise data? Should be ok as it is just public contact data, but just to be on safe side...
