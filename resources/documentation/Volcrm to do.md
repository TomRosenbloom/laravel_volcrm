# Volcrm to do

Create email alerts to self to log activity i.e. any admin registrations or logins and data changes so I can keep on top of the state of the data.

Table of cities, drop down in address form (lift from laravel contacts)

Go to correct page of pagination after *adding* an org

Correct way to add js - compiling to app.js (as per css)

Anonymise data? Should be ok as it is just public contact data, but just to be on safe side... 

Different user categories for Volunteer, Org User

Volunteer profiles, with skill/activity categories & travel range

Phpunit

Code review - SonarQube
